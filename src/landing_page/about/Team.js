          <p>I am currently working on a clone as one of my projects in website
            development. This project is helping me understand the structure,
            design elements, and functionality of real-world websites. By
            recreating the features and layout, I'm improving my skills in HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript, and learning how to build responsive and
            user-friendly interfaces. Itâ€™s a hands-on way to strengthen my
            front-end development knowledge and problem-solving approach.
